// Allocate a new resource manager. If capacity is non-zero, the initial size of the stack will be set to its value. This will improve run time performance by reducing the number of allocations. If capacity is zero, the initial stack size will be set to the value of growth factor, the second parameter. Once the stack's capacity is reached, new allocations will occur after every growth_factor number of calls to the rm_push function. If set to zero, growth_factor will be assigned the default value (see the definition of kDefaultFactor, above). If an error occurs NULL will be returned and errno will be set appropriately. Otherwise, a handle to the new rm instance will returned. It is the caller's responsibility to call rm_free on the handle when it is no longer needed.
